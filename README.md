# Examples

1. The file code_Dra23_Example33.txt contains the code supporting Example 3.3 of the article "Supersingular curves of genus four in characteristic two" by the author and some additional information. It uses the repositories https://github.com/stmar89/AbVarFq and https://github.com/stmar89/PolsAbVarFpCanLift.
2. The files code_UnusualFamily_Lemma31.txt, code_UnusualFamily_Lemma32.txt, and code_UnusualFamily_Proposition35.txt contain the code supporting some of the computations in Lemma 3.1, Lemma 3.2, and Proposition 3.5 of the article "An unusual family of supersingular curves of genus five in characteristic two" by the author.
